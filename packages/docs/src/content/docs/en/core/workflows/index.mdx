AI Kit workflows orchestrate typed sequences of steps inspired by Mastra. Each step declares input/output validation schemas, shares a common context, and can emit real-time events to follow execution.

## Why use workflows?

- **Reliability:** each step is validated by `zod`, which limits runtime surprises and improves observability.
- **Composability:** branch your flows, run steps in parallel, or iterate with `forEach` to cover complex use cases.
- **Integration:** workflows share the same telemetry, runtime, and tool mechanisms as agents, making it easy to combine them.

## Contents of this section

- [`Introduction`](./introduction): core concepts, API overview, and quick-start example.
- [`Human steps`](./etapes-humaines): pause a workflow to request human input and resume execution afterward.
- [`Conditional branches`](./branches-conditionnelles): fork runs depending on user data or AI results.
- [`While loops`](./boucles-while): repeat a step until a condition is met.
- [`Parallel & forEach`](./parallele-et-foreach): process data concurrently and merge the results.
- [`Telemetry`](./telemetry): instrument workflows with Langfuse and the OpenTelemetry stack.
