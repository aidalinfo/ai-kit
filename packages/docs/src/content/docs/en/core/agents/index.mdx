Agents wrap a model, system instructions, and tools to industrialize your AI assistants. This section gathers every page you need to instantiate them, orchestrate their tools, and plug in structured outputs or streaming.

## Main pages

- [`Introduction`](./introduction): installation, agent creation, and first generation.
- [`Tools & tool loop`](./outils): declare default tools and control the orchestration loop.
- [`Structured outputs`](./structured-output): validate responses via `structuredOutput` and the `Output` helpers.
- [`Streaming`](./streaming): consume tokens live and supervise a generation in real time.
- [`Runtime`](./runtime): share binary resources with your tools without exposing file paths in prompts.

## Go further

- Override `system` depending on the request to tweak instructions on demand.
- Adjust `maxOutputTokens`, `temperature`, `topP`, etc. directly in `generate` or `stream`.
- Compose multiple specialized agents (writing, validation, summarization) to cover end-to-end journeys.
- Combine agents and workflows to build richer decision loops.
