This section documents the public classes and functions exported by `@ai_kit/core`. The next pages detail the constructors, options, and methods for `Agent`, `Workflow`, `WorkflowRun`, and `RuntimeStore`.

## Conventions

- Types come from the AI SDK whenever relevant (`LanguageModel`, `ToolSet`, â€¦).
- Signatures are expressed in TypeScript; adapt them to your target language.
- Options marked as *optional* have defaults explained in the documentation.

See the dedicated pages:

- [`Agent`](/en/api-reference/agent)
- [`Workflow`](/en/api-reference/workflow)
- [`WorkflowRun`](/en/api-reference/workflow-run)
- [`RuntimeStore`](/en/api-reference/runtime-store)
