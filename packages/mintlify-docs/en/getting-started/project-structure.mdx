The repository is a PNPM workspace made of multiple packages. Use this overview to navigate the codebase and contribute efficiently.

## Core packages

- `packages/core` – agents, workflows, shared runtime, providers, telemetry.
- `packages/types` – exported public types and shared utilities.
- `packages/mcp` – Model Context Protocol components and agent integrations.
- `packages/mcp-docs-server` – MCP server that surfaces the AI Kit documentation.

## Documentation

- `packages/mintlify-docs` – Mintlify documentation (this site). Add guides and API reference here.
- `packages/docs` – historical Astro documentation. Its content has been migrated to Mintlify.

## Useful scripts

Run these commands from the repository root:

```bash
pnpm lint        # Lint and type-check
pnpm test        # Run the test suite (Jest/Vitest depending on the package)
pnpm dev docs    # Start the local Mintlify preview
```

Use `pnpm --filter <package>` to scope any command, for example `pnpm --filter @ai_kit/core test`.

## Contribution workflow

1. Create a branch, implement your changes, and add tests when it makes sense.
2. Update the Mintlify docs whenever the public API evolves.
3. Double-check that telemetry remains optional and guarded by feature flags.

Pull requests are reviewed with a strong focus on agent stability and workflow compatibility.
