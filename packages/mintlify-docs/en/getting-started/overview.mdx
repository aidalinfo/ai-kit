AI Kit builds on top of the `ai` SDK to interact with your models and layers opinionated helpers for creating typed agents and workflows. This page lists the prerequisites and the next steps to ramp up quickly.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (or any runtime that ships with `fetch`).
- A package manager (`pnpm`, `npm`, or `yarn`).
- Access to an AI SDK compatible provider (Scaleway, OpenAI, Google, …).

## Quick install

```bash
pnpm add @ai_kit/core ai zod
# or
npm install @ai_kit/core ai zod
```

Add the provider client you need (`@ai-sdk/openai`, `@ai-sdk/google`, …).

## What’s next?

- Follow the guide [Build your first agent in 5 minutes](/en/getting-started/first-agent).
- Assemble a typed pipeline with [Build a simple workflow](/en/workflows/introduction).
- Enable tracing with [Langfuse telemetry](/en/telemetry/langfuse).
