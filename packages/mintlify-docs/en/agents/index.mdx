Agents bundle a model, system instructions, and optional tools so you can industrialise your AI assistants. This section covers instantiation, tool management, structured outputs, streaming, and the shared runtime.

## Key guides

- [`Build an agent`](/en/getting-started/first-agent) – install the package and craft your first generation.
- [`Tools & tool loop`](/en/agents/tools) – declare tools and control the orchestration loop.
- [`Structured outputs`](/en/agents/structured-output) – validate responses with `structuredOutput` and the `Output` helpers.
- [`Real-time streaming`](/en/agents/streaming) – consume tokens on the fly and supervise live generations.
- [`Shared runtime`](/en/agents/runtime) – store binary resources and expose them to your tools.

## Best practices

- Override `system` per call to adapt instructions without reinstantiating the agent.
- Tune `maxOutputTokens`, `temperature`, `topP`, and more directly in `generate` or `stream`.
- Compose specialised agents (drafting, validation, summarisation) to cover an entire flow.
- Combine agents with workflows to orchestrate richer decision loops.
