AI Kit relies on OpenTelemetry to capture detailed traces for agents and workflows. This section groups the Langfuse integration guide and workflow-specific options.

## Suggested path

- [Langfuse telemetry](/en/telemetry/langfuse) – install the SDK, initialise `ensureLangfuseTelemetry`, and enable telemetry on agents.
- [Workflow telemetry](/en/workflows/telemetry) – customise the `ai_kit.workflow.*` spans, trace human steps, and add metadata.

## Key concepts

- `telemetry: true | false | {...}` – enable telemetry on agents and workflows.
- `telemetry.metadata` – attach custom attributes visible in Langfuse.
- `telemetry.userId` – link runs to an end user with automatic propagation (`langfuse.user.id`).
- `ensureLangfuseTelemetry` – bootstraps the OTEL provider, handles flush/shutdown, and keeps the dependency optional.

Initialise telemetry early in your application lifecycle to avoid losing events during startup.
